Hopefully you're getting a lot of information about the new transportation applications that have started operating in Albuquerque. My understanding is that the PRC has already told Lyft to stop operation and is investigating whether <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2014/05/23/state-wrecks-uber-s-smooth-ride.html" target="_blank">it will ask Uber to do the same</a>. While I appreciate that your commission is tasked with ensuring fair pricing and safe transit, I feel the PRC is misguided (likely at the behest of the entrenched Taxi Industry) in being so quick to shut down such innovative services. Uber, for example, manages to operate in over 110 cities world-wide, bringing jobs and safe transportation to many. <a href="http://blog.uber.com/uberimpact" target="_blank">Here are some interesting stats on Uber's impact</a>.

We both know how much of an issue DUI is in New Mexico. When Uber started operation in Seattle, <a href="http://blog.uber.com/DUIratesdecline" target="_blank">DUI decreased by more than 10%</a>. That's staggering. The fact is that while alternative transportation exists in taxis and the bus system, people do not choose those options. People choose Uber. Taking this option away from New Mexicans will send a very confusing message about where the PRC's priorities are when it comes to public safety.

New Mexico regularly ranks towards the bottom of the nation when it comes to jobless rate. Services like Uber and Lyft provide a way for people to work part time, fill in around school or family care, or <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/05/27/ubers-remarkable-growth-could-end-the-era-of-poorly-paid-cab-drivers/" target="_blank">create their own businesses</a>. Is the PRC ready to take jobs away from these folks?

I've been using Uber in San Francisco and Denver for over a year, where I have yet to have an unsatisfactory experience. I tried Lyft when they launched in Albuquerque, and now Uber. I know many friends who now rely on Uber to get around when having a few drinks with friends or just when they don't want to deal with parking. I hope you'll see the wisdom in working with both Uber and Lyft so they can continue to operate in Albuquerque and perhaps all of New Mexico.

Thank you for your time,
