So I'm trying out a new blogging platform. Here's the rundown:

- The good folks at <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> have provided us geeks <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, which is a pretty cool way to host a website.
- Using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I can now write my blog posts in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, which is *muy* prefarable to WYSIWYG editors in Wordpress.

I'm going to port at least some of my old blog over. I'm guessing I'm the only one who cares about that stuff, but oh well it's my blog!
